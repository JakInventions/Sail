# Sail
Behold Sail, the best broswers in existence.  Programmed over the course of an entire 20 minutes, Sail's cutting edge, and innovative one tab interface guarantees a unique experience like never before.  Sail also cuts back on many unneccesary things like support for extentions, password saving, enter to search, and custom default search engine.  Sail is open-source, and takes up little space as it is only one executable.
